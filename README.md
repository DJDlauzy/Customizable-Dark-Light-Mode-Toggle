Dark/Light Mode Toggle
A lightweight, reusable JavaScript module to add a dark/light mode toggle to any website, with persistent user preferences using localStorage. 


Toggle between dark and light themes with a button.
Saves user preference in localStorage.
Smooth CSS transitions for theme changes.
Supports system preference detection (dark/light mode).

Installation

Clone or download this repository.
Copy theme-toggle.js and theme-toggle.css into your project.
Include the CSS in your HTML <head>:<link rel="stylesheet" href="theme-toggle.css">


Include the JS before the closing </body> tag:<script src="theme-toggle.js"></script>



Usage

The toggle button is automatically added to your page.
Customize the button's appearance in theme-toggle.css.
Add your own CSS variables in [data-theme="light"] or [data-theme="dark"] to style your site.
